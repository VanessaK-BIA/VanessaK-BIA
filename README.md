Greetings, I'm Vanessa Armstead. 

I am a Business Intelligence Analyst who recently discovered my passion for data analysis. 
I've found that I have a strong foundation in gathering, analysing and interpretting the data that in turn helps drive businesses to growth and to allow them to see a spike in efficiency in regards to operations and processes.
I'm passionate about finding creative solutions to challenges and being able to convey the data in terms that everyone can understand. 
Collaborating with organizations and teams to create groundbreaking and lasting results ; that are in line with making well informed decisions is how I would like to apply my skills as a Business Inntelligence Analyst. I'm eager to apply my skills in analysis and to create visually appealing presentations.
